The "Airline Reservation System" has been developed to address the challenges present in the
existing manual and outdated systems. This software aims to eliminate, and in some cases, reduce the
difficulties faced by the current reservation processes. The system is designed to meet the needs of
airlines by streamlining operations and improving efficiency. It ensures a smooth and effective
management of flight bookings, cancellations, and passenger information. By providing real-time
updates, secure payment processing, and user-friendly interfaces, this system enhances the overall
user experience for both customers and airline staff.
